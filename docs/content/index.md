When you open the application, Vale Server will launch in the background at
`http://localhost:7777` (by default) and you will see this icon <img src="img/menu-icon.png" style="height: 18px; padding-left: 2px; padding-right: 2px">
in your menu bar. Clicking the icon will open a menu that allows you to
interact with the server:

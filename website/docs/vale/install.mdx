Vale offers multiple options for installation, each of which best suits a particular use case. The
quickest way to get started, though, is by using either
[Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/vale#default) (macOS and Linux),
[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/vale) (Windows), or
[Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/jdkato/vale) (any):

:::info Heads up!
If you're using Vale with a markup format other than **Markdown** or **HTML**, you'll also need to
install a [parser](/vale/scoping#formats).

<Tabs
  defaultValue="mac"
  values={[
    { label: 'macOS', value: 'mac', },
    { label: 'Windows', value: 'win', },
    { label: 'Linux', value: 'linux', },
    { label: 'Docker', value: 'docker', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="mac">

```shell
$ brew install vale
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="win">

```bash
> choco install vale
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux">

```bash
$ brew install vale
```
Or use another [package manager](https://repology.org/project/vale/versions).
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="docker">

```bash
$ docker pull jdkato/vale
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can also download and manually install an executable from the
[releases page](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale/releases).

## Using Vale with GitHub

![Example Vale output using GitHub&apos;s annotations UI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8785025/67726924-bf3e6180-f9a4-11e9-9c32-2233756731b9.png)

If you want to lint the contents of a GitHub repository, the recommended approach is to use Vale's [official GitHub Action](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-action).

## Using Vale with a continuous integration \(CI\) service

:::caution

The [`GoDownloader`](https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader/issues/207)
project has been deprecated.

We now recommend that you use the official [GitHub CLI tool](https://cli.github.com/) instead:

```bash
$ gh release download --repo 'errata-ai/vale' -p 'vale_2.11.2_Linux_64-bit.tar.gz'
```

:::

If you want to use Vale with a CI service such as Travis CI, CircleCI, or Jenkins, the recommended approach is to use Vale's [`GoDownloader`](https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader) script \(Vale will be installed to `/bin/vale`\):

```bash
$ curl -sfL https://install.goreleaser.com/github.com/ValeLint/vale.sh | sh -s vX.Y.Z
$ export PATH="./bin:$PATH"
$ vale -v
```

where `vX.Y.Z` is your version of choice from the [releases page](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale/releases). This will ensure that your CI builds are consistent and allow you to update versions on an opt-in basis.

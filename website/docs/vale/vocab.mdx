`Vocab` directories were introduced in Vale `v2.3` to solve a common style
inheritance problem. Consider, for example, the following scenario:

> You're working for an organization that adheres to the
> [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://github.com/errata-ai/Microsoft), so
> you've installed the style and added it to your configuration file.
>
> Over time, you add your own organization's terminology to various rules and
> exception lists (e.g.,
> [Acronyms.yml](https://github.com/errata-ai/Microsoft/blob/master/Microsoft/Acronyms.yml)
> and
> [Headings.yml](https://github.com/errata-ai/Microsoft/blob/master/Microsoft/Headings.yml)).
>
> A few weeks later, a new version of the style is released with a few bug fixes and
> enhancements. What do you do now? You either have to overwrite your changes altogether
> or slowly migrate each customized rule individually.

Vocabularies make this process *much* easier. Each `Vocab` is a single folder
(stored at `<StylesPath>/Vocab/<name>/`) that consists of two plain-text
files&mdash;`accept.txt` and `reject.txt`&mdash;that contain one word, phrase,
or regular expression per line.

The effects of using a custom `Vocab` are as follows:

* Entries in `accept.txt` are added to every exception list in all styles
  listed in `BasedOnStyles`&mdash;meaning that you now only need to update your
  project's *vocabulary* to customize third-party styles (rather than the
  styles themselves).

  `capitalization`- and `conditional`-based rules take the entries as-is
  (case-sensitive), while `spelling`-based rules are always case-insensitive.

* Entries in `accept.txt` are automatically added to a substitution rule
  (`Vale.Terms`), ensuring that any occurrences of these words or phrases
  exactly match their corresponding entry in `accept.txt`.

* Entries in `reject.txt` are automatically added to an existence rule
  (`Vale.Avoid`) that will flag all occurrences as errors.

This means that your exceptions can be developed independent of a style,
allowing you to use the same exceptions with multiple styles or switch styles
without having to re-implement them:

```ini
StylesPath = "..."

# Here's were we define the exceptions to use in *all*
# `BasedOnStyles`.
Vocab = Some-Name

MinAlertLevel = suggestion

[*]
# Automatically respects all custom exceptions.
#
# The built-in 'Vale' style is required for using
# `Vale.Terms`, `Vale.Avoid`, or `Vale.Spelling`.
BasedOnStyles = Vale, MyStyle
```

See [Configuration](/vale/config) for more information.

## Folder structure

`Vocab` entries are stored in `<StylesPath>/Vocab/<name>/` and are then
referenced by `<name>` in `.vale.ini`. For example, consider the following
folder structure:

```bash
$ tree styles
├───MyStyle
├───Vocab
│   ├───Blog
│   └───Marketing
└───MyOtherStyle
```

Here, our `StylesPath` (`/styles`) contains two styles (`MyStyle` and
`MyOtherStyle`) and two vocabularies (`Blog` and `Marketing`). You can then
simply reference these entries by their folder name:

```ini title=".vale.ini"
StylesPath = styles

Vocab = Blog

[*]
BasedOnStyles = Vale, MyStyle
```

## File format

Both `accept.txt` and `reject.txt` are plain-text files that take one
entry per line:

```text
first
[pP]y.*\b
third
```

The entries are case-sensitive (except for rules extending `spelling`, as
mentioned above) and may also be regular expressions.

## Relation to ignore files

The functionality of vocabularies is similar to the existing concept of
[*ignore* files](styles#ignoring-non-dictionary-words). The major differences
are that vocabularies apply to multiple extension points (rather than just
`spelling`), support regular expressions, and have built-in rules associated
with them (`Vale.Terms` and `Vale.Avoid`).

In general, this means that ignore files are for style *creators* while
vocabularies are for style *users*:

* If you're developing or maintaining a style, you may still want to include a
  custom `spelling` rule&mdash;`MyStyle.Spelling`&mdash;that packages its own
  ignore files.

* As a user of styles, vocabularies should be able to replace the use of ignore
  files completely.

  For example, if you were using `Vale.Spelling` with a `<StylesPath>/vocab.txt`
  file prior to `v2.3`, you can simply copy the contents of `vocab.txt` into
  `<StylesPath>/Vocab/<MyVocab>/accept.txt` and it'll work the same (you may
  also want to disable `Vale.Terms` and `Vale.Avoid` to replicate the exact
  experience).

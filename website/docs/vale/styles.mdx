Vale has a powerful extension system that doesn't require knowledge of
any programming language. Instead, it uses collections of individual
[YAML](http://yaml.org) files (or "rules") to enforce particular writing
constructs.

```yaml title="HeadingPunctuation.yml"
# An example rule from the "Microsoft" style.
extends: existence
message: "Don't use end punctuation in headings."
link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/punctuation/periods
nonword: true
level: warning
scope: heading
action:
  name: edit
  params:
    - remove
    - '.?!'
tokens:
  - '[a-z0-9][.?!](?:\s|$)'
```

These collections are referred to as *styles* and are organized in a
nested folder structure at a user-specified location
(see [Configuration](/vale/config)). For example,

```text
styles/
├── base/
│   ├── ComplexWords.yml
│   ├── SentenceLength.yml
│   ...
├── blog/
│   ├── TechTerms.yml
│   ...
└── docs/
    ├── Branding.yml
    ...
```

where _base_, _blog_, and _docs_ are your styles that each contain certain
rules.

## Extension points

:::info Heads up!
Vale uses Go's [regexp package](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/) to
evaluate all patterns in rule definitions. This means that lookarounds and
backreferences aren't supported.

This shouldn't be a limitation, though, [as Vale offers its own ways](https://medium.com/@jdkato/rule-authoring-101-ca066233970c?source=friends_link&sk=85ff5198b7548b326d6aaab43aca40f9) to achieve same behavior.
:::

The building blocks of styles are rules (YAML files ending in `.yml`), which utilize extension points to perform specific tasks.

The basic structure of a rule consists of a small header \(shown below\) followed by extension-specific arguments.

```yaml
# All rules should define the following header keys:
#
# `extends` indicates the extension point being used (see below for information
# on the possible values).
extends: existence
# `message` is shown to the user when the rule is broken.
#
# Many extension points accept format specifiers (%s), which are replaced by
# extracted values. See the exention-specific sections below for more details.
message: "Consider removing '%s'"
# `level` assigns the rule's severity.
#
# The accepted values are suggestion, warning, and error.
level: warning
# `scope` specifies where this rule should apply -- e.g., headings, sentences, etc.
#
# See the Markup section for more information on scoping.
scope: heading
# `link` gives the source for this rule.
link: 'https://errata.ai/'
# The number of times this rule should raise an alert.
#
# By default, there is no limit.
limit: 1
```

The available extension points are discussed below.

### `existence`

<Existence />

### `substitution`

<Substitution />

### `occurrence`

<Occurrence />

### `repetition`

<Repetition />

### `consistency`

<Consistency />

### `conditional`

<Conditional />

### `capitalization`

<Capitalization />

### `readability`

<Readability />

### `spelling`

<Spelling />

### `sequence` (v2.3.0)

<Sequence />

## Built-in style

:::info Heads up!
The built-in `Vale.Spelling` rule will respect an ignore file stored at
`StylesPath/vocab.txt`. *However*, the recommended approach is to use a
[custom Vocab](vocab) instead.
:::

Vale comes with a single built-in style named `Vale` that implements three rules,
as described in the table below.

| Rule              | Scope  | Level   | Description                                                         |
|-------------------|--------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Vale.Spelling`   | `text` | `error` | Spell checks text while respecting the active project's vocabulary. |
| `Vale.Terms`      | `text` | `error` | Enforces the current project's `Preferred` [vocabulary terms](/vale/vocab).                    |
| `Vale.Avoid`      | `text` | `error` | Enforces the current project's `Do not use` [vocabulary terms](/vale/vocab).                    |

## Third-party styles

Vale has a growing selection of pre-made styles available for download from its
[style library](https://github.com/errata-ai/styles), and community-maintained styles you can find by searching for the "[vale-linter-style](https://github.com/topics/vale-linter-style)" tag on GitHub.

The Vale Server API provides a means of communicating with the Vale Server desktop application, which manages user settings and interfaces with the Vale CLI tool, from third-party "client" applications:

All of the official Vale Server clients&mdash;[Atom][1], [Sublime Text][2], [Visual Studio Code][3], [Google Docs][5], and [Google Chrome][4]&mdash;use this API to communicate with the core desktop application.

**NOTE**: Unlike most production APIs, the Vale Server API is embedded within the desktop application itself and runs on `localhost`. This means that users don't have to send their text to a remote server, but it also means that **you'll have to have an instance of Vale Server running to test the API here**.
